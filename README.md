# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their spaces with either "X" or "O". The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all spaces are filled and no player has achieved this, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Supports two players taking turns
- Detects win conditions and ties
- No scoring system; the game simply ends when a player wins or the game is tied.

1. **Start the Game**: Players enter their names to begin.
2. **Choose Symbols**: The first player will play with "X", and the second player will play with "O".
3. **Take Turns**: Players take turns to place their marks on the grid.
4. **Win or Tie**: The game ends when one player has three marks in a row or when all spaces are filled resulting in a tie.
